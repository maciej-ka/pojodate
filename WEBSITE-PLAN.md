# Website ideas
**happy developers**
developer experience is goal
happy developers are goal
library is nice to use
pictures of nice to use things?
not coffee, tea instead

**font**
leisure type of font
not minimalistic, also not very decorative
sort of font some of coffee maker machines use
like a comfortable old car logo, oldtimers

**user dates**
have a sort of js console with autocomplete popup
let user give some dates on entry
suggest next christmas or birth date of user or their kids
and set them as variable
and be able to play with library
also store them in localstorage
and perhaps present in some usefull way?

**timer**
let user create timers with labels
store them in localstorage
alert on timeout

# Landing content plan
**goal**
nice to work with set, add, format functions
avoid wrapper hell

**get month start, month end?**
set: allow for "last" as day value

**just format iso or unpadded**
`format.iso`
`format.unpadded`

**humanize durations**
`diff`
`format.ago`
`format.until`
`format.significant`
`format.humanize?`

**extending Date, is it safe?**
export to Date to pass to external libs

**why the name**
plain old javascript object
date represented as object is nice to work with
